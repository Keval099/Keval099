### About Me

Dynamic and growth-oriented Quality Engineer, at the start of my carrier I started leveraging a blend of manual and automation testing skills to deliver software solutions of the highest quality. Entering the technology landscape in 2021, I commenced my journey as a Functional Tester on Guidewire software, which deepened my understanding of insurance industry requirements and sharpened my ability to recognize crucial functionalities and identify discrepancies. Within a year, I embraced the opportunity to transition into an Automation Tester role, utilizing Jruby language and Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) frameworks, thus enhancing test efficiency and accuracy.

Recognizing the importance of continuous learning in the ever-evolving tech industry, I have skillfully adapted my expertise, augmenting my testing toolkit with Java, Selenium, Maven, and TestNG. This self-driven up-skilling underpins my ability to deliver comprehensive, efficient, and automated test solutions. Passionate about achieving quality outcomes, managing risks, and deploying high-standard products, I am now eager to apply and expand my knowledge in challenging environments, contributing through my analytical insights and dedication towards achieving excellence.
